----------------------------------------------------------------------

SETS-GLOBALS: GLOBALS!! Don't use global variables, i.e., N N
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DOLIST-SETF: Don't use SETQ inside DOLIST to accumulate values for N.
Use DO. Make N a DO variable and don't use SETQ etc at all.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

USE-EQL: Unless something special is going on, use EQL, not EQUAL.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

X-PLUS-1: Don't use (+ N 1), use (1+ N) for its value or (INCF N) to
change N, whichever is appropriate here.
