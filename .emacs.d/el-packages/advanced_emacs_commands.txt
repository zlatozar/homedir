1. Common default Emacs key prefixes

Key prefix      Description
----------      -----------
C-c             Commands particular to the current editing mode
C-x             Commands for files and buffers
C-h             Help commands
M-x             Literal function name
C-h b           Show all key bindings
C-h m           Show key bindings for current mode

When you have long combination (C-c . f ede-find-file) and you know only first part (C-c .)
Then typing C-c . and then C-h Emacs will tell you all possibilities.

2. Emacs window-manipulation commands

Key prefix        Function                        Description

undefined         scroll-all-mode                 Toggle the scroll-all minor mode. When it's on, all windows displaying
                                                  the buffer in the current window are scrolled simultaneously and in equal, relative amounts.

                                                  preceded by a negative, this makes the current window shorter by a line.

undefined        compare-windows                  Compare the current window with the next window, beginning with point in both windows and
                                                  moving point in both buffers to the first character that differs until reaching the end of the buffer.

3. Emacs text manipulation commands

5. Emacs commands for using registers

Emacs registers are general-purpose storage mechanisms that can store one of many things, including text,
a rectangle, a position in a buffer, or some other value or setting. Every register has a label, which is
a single character that you use to reference it. A register can be redefined, but it can contain only one thing at a time.
Once you exit Emacs, all registers are cleared.

Key prefix        Function                   Description
----------        --------                   -----------
C-x r space X     point-to-register          Save point to register X.
C-x r s X         copy-to-register           Save the region to register X.
C-x r r X         copy-rectangle-to-register Save the selected rectangle to register X.
undefined         view-register              View the contents of a given register.
C-x r j X         jump-to-register           Move point to the location given in register X.
C-x r i X         insert-register            Insert the contents of register X at point.

6. Emacs commands for using bookmarks

Emacs has another facility for saving positions in buffers. These Emacs bookmarks work the same as registers, but their
labels can be longer than a single character, and they're more permanent: If you save them, you can use them between sessions.
They persist until you remove them. As their name implies, bookmarks are handy for saving your position in a buffer so that you
can return to it at a later time, most often during a later Emacs session.

Key prefix        Function                   Description
----------        --------                   -----------
C-x r m Bookmark  bookmark-set               Set a bookmark named Bookmark.
C-x r l           bookmarks-bmenu-list       List all saved bookmarks.
undefined         bookmark-delete            Delete a bookmark.
C-x r b Bookmark  bookmark-jump              Jump to the location set in the bookmark named Bookmark.
undefined         bookmark-save              Save all bookmarks to the bookmark file, ~/.emacs.bmk.(you can redefine it)

7. Emacs commands for using rectangles

Did you ever wish you could select a box of text from a document for copying, killing, or yanking purposes?
You can. In Emacs, a selection of text specified by any two opposite of its four corners is called a rectangle.

Key prefix        Function                   Description
----------        --------                   -----------
C-space           set-mark-command           Marks one corner of a rectangle (point marks the opposite corner).
C-x r k           kill-rectangle             Kills the current rectangle and saves it in a special rectangle buffer.
C-x r d           delete-rectangle           Deletes the current rectangle and doesn't save it for yanking.
C-x r c           clear-rectangle            Clears the current rectangle, replacing the entire area with whitespace.
C-x r y           yank-rectangle             Yanks the contents of the last-killed rectangle at point, moving all existing text to the right.
C-x r o           open-rectangle             Opens the current rectangle, filling the entire area with whitespace
                                             and moving all text from the rectangle to the right.

8. Transient Mark Mode

Key prefix        Function                   Description
----------        --------                   -----------
C-SPC                                        Make mark in some place and then disable it with C-g.
                                             Go somewhere else and do it again and again etc.

C-SPC C-SPC                                  Make mark and you can return with C-u C-SPC
C-u C-SPC                                    Back to previous mark, and back and back etc.

C-x C-SPC         pop-global-mark            Jumps to the position of the latest entry in the global mark ring.

However, Emacs saves up to 16 previous values of the mark, and you can jump to previous ones with C-u C-SPC.
This makes mark and the mark ring a valuable navigation tool. You can use it somewhat mindlessly:
if you ever find yourself asking "where was I just now?" you can often just press C-u C-SPC until you find yourself back in the right place.

9. Programming

Key prefix           Function                  Description
----------           --------                  -----------
M-x                  check-parens              Checking for unmatched parentheses
C-x w h REGEXP FACE                            Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.
C-x w p PHRASE FACE                            Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.
                                               (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches
                                               to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)

C-x w l REGEXP FACE                            Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.
C-x w r REGEX                                  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer

M-C-\                indent-region             Indent a region to match the first line in region.

Example 1:
In the C++ modes when editing multi-line comments started with * or // (i.e. just type the comment as all one paragraph,
then mark it and C-M-\ will re-format, leading each line with the right number of spaces and a * or // ).

Example 2: Find and replace recursively
Lets say you want to replace all the instances of "foo" with "bar" in all files of type .py in some directory (and in all its sub-directories).
So, do the following:

Run M-x find-dired and follow the prompt. Namely, choose the base directory (. in our case) and the type (.py).
This will open a buffer listing in dired all the files matching the type. Hit Q and enter the regexp you look for and the replacement.


10. Shell

Keys are the same as in Bash prompt only C-c is added as prefix.

Key prefix          Function                   Description

C-c C-u             kill-shell-input           Erase the current line.
C-c C-z             stop-shell-subjob          Suspend the current shell job.

11. Macro Commands

Key prefix          Function                   Description
----------          --------                   -----------
C-x (               start-kbd-macro            Start a new macro definition.
C-x )               end-kbd-macro              End the current macro definition.
                    name-last-kbd-macro        Name the last macro before saving it then you can execute it using M-x <your-macro-name>
                 apply-macro-to-region-lines   Apply macro to selected region
