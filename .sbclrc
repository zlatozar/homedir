;; Quicklisp includes ASDF2. I like to set up ASDF2 to scan a particular directory tree, ~/projects/lisp/, for local systems.

;; Create a config file named ~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/projects.conf that has this in it:
;;      (:tree (:home "projects/lisp/"))
;;
;; With that file in place, you can add new projects to that directory tree, and after an
;;      (asdf:initialize-source-registry)
;;
;; the project's systems will be loadable with asdf:load-system.  You can unpack tarballs, check
;; things out from source control systems, or create new projects and they'll all be easily available for loading.
