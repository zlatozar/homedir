/**
 * @mainpage  Project.Template
 *
 * Doxygen allows you to specify overview documentation for your entire API using the "mainpage"
 * comment. This lets you provide a high-level description of the API, as well as provide a breakdown
 * of the major classes. This description will appear on the front page of the documentation that Doxygen
 * produces. It is common to store these comments in a separate file
 *
 * @author username@host.com
 *
 * @section ProjectTemplateIntro Introduction
 * This project will make you breakfast, clean your flat and do your laundry.
 *
 * @section ProjectTemplateOverview Project Overview
 * 
 * The text in this overview documentation may be long enough to justify breaking into separate
 * sections. In which case, you can use the "section" and "subsection" commands to introduce this
 * structure. You can even create separate pages to contain more detailed descriptions for certain parts
 * of your API. This can be done with the "page" command.
 *
 * Also, you may find it useful to define groups of behavior for your API so that you can break up
 * the various classes in your API into different categories. For example, you could create groups for
 * classes or files pertaining to file handling, container classes, logging, versioning, and so on. This
 * is done by declaring a group with "defgroup" and then using the "ingroup" to add any specific element
 * to that group.
 *
