The task
___________________________________________________

A file contains a sequence of integer numbers stored one per line.
There might be lines that do not entirely represent integers, e.g. 2u1, 23.9, #12, etc.
Such lines are considered as comments, i.e they do not carry numbers.

A) Define a java.util.Iterator<Integer> with 'remove()' operation not supported
that iterates over the integers persisted in a file compliant with the above format;

B) Let 'A' be an integer, A > 0, provided as an input parameter to the system.

Find those file line numbers 'i' and 'j' for which:

- j = i + A, and
- lines i and j are not comments, and
- sum of the integers at lines 'i' and 'j' is maximum, and
- i is the least one, if multiple found

Respond with a specific error on any condition that prevent the system to find a solution.

Write a Java program and test code enough to demonstrate that your solution addresses the problem.
