    ~ What is SMOOK?


    ~ Is it ready?


    ~ What do I need?


    ~ Where are the docs?

    ~ How to build it?

      $ make

    ~ How to install Jython?

      Install latest version:

      1. Download from jython.org

      $ sudo mkdir /opt/jython
      $ sudo chown user:group /opt/jython
      $ java -jar jython-installer-2.7-b1.jar -s -d /opt/jython/ -t all

      If you set up a symlink to the 'jython' command, you may be seeing the
      'error expr: syntax error' whenever you run a script. The solution is to open the file jythonin a text editor, locate the line

      if expr "$link" : '/' > /dev/null; then

      and replace it with the line

      if expr "$link" : '[/]' > /dev/null; then

    ~ How to start coding?

      Needs pip, jython and python to be installed

      Easy start:
      $ cd <path to SMOOK>
      $ sudo -E pip install -r requirements-env.txt

      Using virtualenv (not working!!)

      Create virtual environment

      $ virtualenv -p jython smook-env

      $ source smook-env/bin/activate
      $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

      Version 2.5.2 (working)

      $ cd <path to SMOOK>
      $ sudo jython scripts/ez_setup.py
      $ sudo jython <path to jython>/bin/easy_install pytest

    ~ Project structure and tools

    ~ Do we have Python codding style?

      Read STYLE

    ~ Where are the tests?

      Good that you're asking.

        $ make test

      If you just want one particular testcase to run you can
      provide it on the command line:

        $ py.test -v <your test>
