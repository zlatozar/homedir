Paradigms of AI Programming Source Code
=======================================

This page is the index for the Lisp source code files for the book *Paradigms
of Artificial Intelligence Programming*. The code is offered as open source
freeware under `this license`_. You can browse all the files in the github
repository.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

#. ``git clone`` the source code from the github repository.

#. You must have a lisp compiler/interpreter.

#. To test all the code, start lisp in the project directory and do the
   following at the interactive prompt:

.. code:: lisp

   (load "auxfns.lisp")
   (in-package :paip)
   (requires "examples")
   (do-examples :all)

This should print out a long list of inputs and outputs, and the last
output should be the total number of errors. If all goes well, this should be
"0".

If you would like to run the examples for just a given chapter, you can do that
as well. For instance, once you have done ``(requires "examples")``, this will
execute the examples for Chapter 3:

.. code:: lisp

   (do-chapter 3 *standard-output*)

Use
---

To use the code, edit any of the files or add new files. You will always
have to do ``(load "auxfns.lisp")`` first, and you will typically have to do
``(requires "file")``, for various instances of *file* that you want to use.

The function "requires" is used for a primitive form of control over what files
require other files to be loaded first. If "requires" does not work properly on
your system you may have to alter its definition, in the file "auxfns.lisp".
For more complicated use of these files, you should follow the guidelines for
organizing files explained in Chapter 24.

The function ``do-examples``, which takes as an argument either ``:all`` or a
chapter number or a list of chapter numbers, can be used to see examples of the
use of various functions. For example, ``(do-examples 1)`` shows the examples
from chapter 1.
