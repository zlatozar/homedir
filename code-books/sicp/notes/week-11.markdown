# Week 11 (2012-05-08 - 2012-05-15)

We decided that this is going to be the week we finish chapter 2. Whatever
happens by the end of the week, we move to chapter 03 in the next week.

To note the occasion, I gathered everybody at home and cooked some dinner.

## Meetup summary

It was me, Veselin, Plamen and Slavena. Nobody had any progress in the past
weeks. We decided that we should not keep strugling with the rest of chapter
02 - we should move forward instead.

We decided that we will skip the next Tuesday and have a very simple,
achievable target for after two weeks.
