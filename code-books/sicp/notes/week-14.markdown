## On Scheme and VimScript

I tweeted that reading the book made me a VimScript programmer. That is a very awkward statement, yet anyway, it highlights a fundamental truth - spending all my time in OOP languages, I've lost confidence in writing structured, non-OO code. In that sense, the book provides a freash breath of air - I get to excercise my "structured programming muscles" and I can later apply them in a suboptimal environment like VimScript (or possibly Emacs Lisp?).

There is a more general notion here about going with the current, being intuitive or analyzing everything I do.
