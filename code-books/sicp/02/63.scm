; Each of the following two procedures converts a binary tree to a list.
;
; (define (tree->list-1 tree)
;   (if (null? tree)
;       '()
;       (append (tree->list-1 (left-branch tree))
;               (cons (entry tree)
;                     (tree->list-1 (right-branch tree))))))
;
; (define (tree->list-2 tree)
;   (define (copy-to-list tree result-list)
;     (if (null? tree)
;         result-list
;         (copy-to-list (left-branch tree)
;                       (cons (entry tree)
;                             (copy-to-list (right-branch tree) result-list)))))
;   (copy-to-list tree '()))
;
; a. Do the two procedures produce the same result for every tree? If not, how
;    do the results differ? What lists do the two procedures produce for the
;    trees in Figure 2.16?
; b. Do the two procedures have the same order of growth in the number of steps
;    required to convert a balanced tree with n elements to a list? If not,
;    which one grows more slowly?

; a. Yes. They don't. All six variants generate (1 3 5 7 9 11)
;
; b. No. tree->list-2 tends to grow slower, both in space and time.
;
; First of all, it is recursive only on the right branches, but iterative on
; the left ones, and second, it does not invlove any calls to append (which is
; linear to the size of the first list). In all cases tree->list-2 finishes in
; Î˜(n).
