; Consider the problem of designing a signal-processing system to study the
; homogeneous second-order linear differential equation
;
;   d²y    dy
;   ─── - a── - by = 0
;   dt²    dt
;
; The output stream, modeling y, is generated by a network that contains a
; loop. This is because the value of d²y/dt² depends upon the values of y and
; dy/dt and both of these are determined by integrating d²y/dt². The diagram
; we would like to encode is shown in figure 3.35. Write a procedure solve-2nd
; that takes as arguments the constants a, b and dt and the initial values y₀
; and dy₀ for y and dy/dt and generates the stream of successive values of y.

(define (solve-2nd a b dt y0 dy0)
  (define y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
  (define dy (integral (delay ddy) dy0 dt))
  (define ddy (add-streams (scale-stream dy a)
                           (scale-stream y b)))
  y)
