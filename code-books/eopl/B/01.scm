; The following grammar for ordinary arithmetic expressions builds in the
; usual precendence in the usual rules for arithmetic operations:
;
;   Arith-expr        ::= Arith-term {Additive-op Arith-term}*
;   Arith-term        ::= Arith-factor {Multiplicative-op Arith-factor}*
;   Arith-factor      ::= Number
;                     ::= (Arith-expr)
;   Additive-op       ::= + | -
;   Multiplicative-op ::= * | /
;
; This grammar says that every arithmetic expression is the sum of a non-empty
; sequence of terms; every term is the product of a non-empty sequence of
; factors; and every factor is either a constant or a parenthesized
; expression.
;
; Write a lexical specification and a grammar in SLLGEN that will scan and
; parse strings according to this grammar. Verify that this grammar handles
; precendence correctly, so that, for example 3+2*66-5 gets grouped correctly,
; as 3 + (2 Ã— 66) - 5.
