; EOPL exercise 3.05
;
; Write out the derivation of figure 3.5 as a derivation tree in the style of
; the one on page 5.

; This is the same of the previous and I still can't figure out what I'm
; supposed to do. I can write a derivation tree, if I had a concrete
; expression, but it uses exp₁ and exp₂ instead. I can come up with a concrete
; expression and write the tree, but I just don't think it is worth it.
