; EOPL exercise 3.04
;
; Write out the derivation of figure 3.4 as a derivation tree in the style of
; one on page 5.

; I cannot figure this exercise out. Figure 3.4 is:
;
; (value-of (if-exp exp₁ exp₂ exp₃) p)
;
; = (if (expval->bool (value-of exp₁ p))
;     (value-of exp₂ p)
;     (value-of exp₃ p))
;
; I have no clue how to represent this as a derivation tree. Next!
