# Week 3 (2013-05-19 - 2013-05-25)

I dropped the book for quite a while. Now I am picking it up again. This is not really the third week, but I will consider it so for the record keeping.

Exercises 3.23 - 3.25 show recursion in a language that can only bind variables with `let`. I knew that you can use the Y-combinator to accomoplish this, but I was not aware that there was a way to write a recursive function without it.

## Recursion with dynamic binding

It appears that recursion with dynamic binding is pretty straightforward - the interpreter did not need any modification in order to run.
