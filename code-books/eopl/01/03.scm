; EOPL exercise 1.03
;
; Find a set T of natural numbers such that 0 ∈ T, and whenever n ∈ T, then
; n + 3 ∈ T, but T ≠ S, where S is the set defined in definition 1.1.2.

; I really don't get the point of this exercise, since it looks simple enough,
; but if we add that 1 ∈ T, then T would be a subset of S and therefore
; different than it. Note that it will be the union of S and {n + 1 | n ∈ N}.
